        <h2>What is the Guitar?</h2>
        <p>I like playing the guitar in my free time and I like playing songs for my friends. The guitar is a string instrument that usually consists of six strings. It is played by plucking or strumming the strings with the fingers or a pick. Guitars come in various types, including acoustic, electric, and classical.</p>
        <p>Playing the guitar can be a fulfilling hobby and a form of artistic expression. It allows individuals to create music, entertain themselves, and connect with others through shared musical experiences.</p>

    <section id="when">
        <h2>When Do I Play the Guitar?</h2>
        <p>I like to play the guitar in my free time, especially during breaks or just when I am bored. I also play when someone asks me to play them something when they find out I play the guitar. Since my guitar is in the living room, and since it pops up someone new that comes in the apartment always says something about it and ofcouurse they ask me to play.</p>
        <p>I have recently started trying to play the guitar more because I want to get back into it. After highschool, school started getting harder which made it harder to find time to play the guitar. Also, I am not going to lie in my free time you will probably find me scrolling on tiktok or watching netflix instead of playing it.</p>

        <h2>How do I play the Guitar?</h2>
        <p>I learned the guitar in middle school in my guitar class, I have since been playing it here and there.Besides my guitar class, I have learned it on youtube, this is how I learned some of the newer songs. I also have learned on websites that have the online sheet music on them.</p>
        <p>If one wants to learn the guitar there are different routes that he or she can take. They can get a guitar teacher, however this will cost money. Instead one could go on youtube and watch videos, however without a teacher it can be tricky. One could also just learn by asking a friend to.</p>

        <p>I like playing the guitar because it relieves stress and also I think it is fun. I also have always liked music so when I toured my middle school and saw them play it I was interested and was like "I'll join the guitar class!" It is also just nice to know how to play an instrument.</p>
