            <h3><a href="https://www.nike.com">Nike</a></h3>
            <p>Nike's official website is a premier destination for athletic footwear, apparel, and accessories, showcasing an excellent blend of aesthetics, functionality, and user experience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: Strong contrast between background and text, as well as vibrant images against a clean backdrop.</li>
                <li>Repetition: Consistent color scheme, typography, and thematic elements across all pages.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Well-aligned content with a clear grid structure, making the layout visually appealing.</li>
                <li>Proximity: Logically grouped related items and information, making navigation intuitive.</li>

            <h3><a href="https://www.craigslist.org">Craigslist</a></h3>
            <p>Craigslist is a classified advertisements website with a minimalist design that prioritizes functionality over modern aesthetics, often appearing outdated.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: Uses contrast effectively but lacks visual appeal to make important sections stand out.</li>
                <li>Repetition: Consistent but dated appearance due to basic color scheme and font use.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Functional and straightforward layout but lacks dynamic engagement.</li>
                <li>Proximity: Groups related content effectively but can overwhelm with dense packing of links and text.</li>
            </ul>
